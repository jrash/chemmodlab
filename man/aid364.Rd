\title{Cytotoxicity assay using the Jurkat human T-Cell line}
\format{
Data frame with 500 rows and 173 columns.  The first column contains the compound ids. 
The second contains the outcome of the assay (a binary variable, indicating active/inactive).
The next columns are chemical descriptor columns.  Two descriptor sets are present.
Both of these sets were computed
using the software, PowerMV - see Liu et al. (2005) for more information. The first set of 24
continuous descriptors are a modification of the Burden number descriptors (Burden, 1989). 
The second set contains 147 binary descriptors,
indicating the presence/absence of "pharmacophore" features, described in more detail in
Liu et al. (2005).

\description{
These data are from a cytotoxicity assay conducted by the Scripps Research
Institute Molecular Screening Center. There are 500 compounds assessed for toxicity using the
the Jurkat human T-Cell line. 50 of these compounds were active (toxic). Visit
